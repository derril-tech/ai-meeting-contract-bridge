AI Meeting Contract Bridge — after meetings, generate draft agreements/contracts from decisions 

 

1) Product Description & Presentation 

One-liner 

“Bridge meeting discussions to actionable contracts: auto-generate draft agreements from decisions, tasks, and commitments.” 

What it produces 

Draft contracts/agreements aligned to meeting outcomes (e.g., NDAs, MoUs, SLAs, project agreements). 

Structured decision logs: who agreed to what, obligations, deadlines. 

Clause library references: compliant boilerplates for confidentiality, IP, payment terms. 

Editable documents: Word/PDF/Markdown exports, with tracked assumptions. 

JSON bundle: structured commitments, clauses, and references for integration with CLM (Contract Lifecycle Management) tools. 

Scope/Safety 

Produces drafts only, not legally binding until lawyer-reviewed. 

Clause libraries from open-licensed, standards-based templates (e.g., Creative Commons contracts, UN/ICC sample clauses). 

Configurable for jurisdictions & contract types. 

Confidential data encrypted; audit trail of all drafts. 

 

2) Target User 

Startups & SMEs converting meeting agreements into lightweight contracts quickly. 

Legal teams wanting first drafts auto-structured. 

Project managers ensuring decisions become binding documents. 

Consultants & freelancers generating SoWs/NDAs from client calls. 

 

3) Features & Functionalities (Extensive) 

Ingestion & Capture 

Input sources: Meeting transcripts (Zoom, Teams, Meet), uploaded minutes, manual notes. 

Speaker attribution: diarization & role tagging (client, vendor, manager, legal). 

Decision extraction: obligations, deadlines, approvals, deliverables. 

Entity recognition: parties, org names, monetary amounts, dates, governing laws. 

Drafting Contracts 

Clause suggestion engine: select relevant templates from clause library. 

Auto-populate: fill obligations, parties, deliverables, amounts. 

Fallbacks: mark unresolved placeholders (e.g., TBD payment terms). 

Contextual tailoring: NDAs for early-stage calls, MoUs for collaborations, SoWs for projects. 

Clause Library & Compliance 

Built-in open-licensed clause sets (confidentiality, indemnity, arbitration, data protection). 

Industry-specific add-ons (healthcare, finance, SaaS). 

Configurable jurisdictional variants (US, UK, EU, APAC). 

Flag risky or missing clauses for legal review. 

Reporting & Exports 

Draft contract view: clause-by-clause with editable inline text. 

Obligations table: responsibilities, parties, deadlines. 

Comparison view: draft vs standard templates (highlight deviations). 

Exports: DOCX, PDF, Markdown, JSON (for CLM). 

Q&A & Coaching 

“Why is this clause here?” explanations. 

Q&A with the contract: ask what’s missing, what’s risky, what’s standard. 

Prep notes: list of likely lawyer questions before signing. 

Collaboration & Governance 

Multi-user workspaces with roles (Owner/Editor/Reviewer/Viewer). 

Track changes + version history. 

Review workflow: assign clause approvals to legal, finance, ops. 

Audit log of every draft generated, edited, and exported.

qa-worker (explain clauses, highlight risks, suggest improvements). 

export-worker (DOCX/PDF/Markdown/JSON bundle). 

Event bus/queues: NATS (meeting.ingest, decisions.extract, draft.make, qa.ask, export.make) + Redis Streams. 

Datastores: 

Postgres 16 (projects, meetings, decisions, drafts, clauses, exports). 

S3/R2 (transcripts, exported docs).

7) DevOps & Deployment 

FE: Vercel (Next.js). 

APIs/Workers: Render/Fly/GKE; pools: transcript/decision/draft/qa/export. 

DB: Managed Postgres; PITR; read replicas. 

Cache/Bus: Redis + NATS. 

Storage: S3/R2 for transcripts, contracts. 

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint/typecheck/unit/integration, Docker, scan, deploy). 

IaC: Terraform for DB/Redis/NATS/buckets/CDN/secrets. 

Envs: dev/staging/prod. 

Operational SLOs 

Transcript parse (60m meeting) < 30s p95. 

Draft contract gen (5-page) < 12s p95. 

Export DOCX/PDF < 5s p95. 

 

8) Testing 

Unit: NER accuracy (parties, obligations, dates, amounts). 

Integration: transcript → decisions → draft → QA → export. 

E2E: upload transcript → generate contract → export PDF → verify clause mapping. 

Load: 100 meetings simultaneous, 1k drafts/day. 

Chaos: corrupted transcript, missing party names. 

Security: RLS enforcement; signed URL integrity. 

 

9) Success Criteria 

Product KPIs 

Time-to-first draft from meeting → < 15 minutes median. 

Draft lawyer acceptance rate (minor edits only) ≥ 70%. 

Decision-to-clause coverage ≥ 90%. 

User satisfaction ≥ 4.5/5. 

Engineering SLOs 

Pipeline success ≥ 99% excl. bad inputs. 

Export error rate < 1%. 

SSE/WS drop < 0.5%. 

 

10) Visual/Logical Flows 

A) Meeting → Decisions 

 Upload transcript → diarization → extract obligations/agreements → decision table. 

B) Decisions → Draft 

 Select contract type → fill template clauses with meeting data → placeholders for gaps. 

C) Draft → QA 

 Ask questions → AI explains clause logic, flags missing items. 

D) Export 

 Finalize draft → export DOCX/PDF/JSON → archive with audit trail.
